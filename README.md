### the story of the rustybucket
Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell
'Bout a bucket that collected things so well
Started off shiny, new and clean
But soon enough, it got old and mean
Got rusty, crusty, covered in grime
It wasn't worth a single dime

Shake that bucket, shake it fast
Collecting dust, it won't last
Shake that bucket, shake it clean
Or else it'll turn into a rusty machine
